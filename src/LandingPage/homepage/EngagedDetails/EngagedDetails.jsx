                    <p>Too many times if you ask canned questions, they lose interest in you.

                        By asking them an unexpected question, you can truly get them thinking.

                        Successfully engage with them at a much higher level and the conversation–even the relationship–will change.

                    <p>Why are you just talking to one person at that company you want to do business with? Be talking to four or five.

                        If you want to keep the prospect engaged, get multiple people participating. Spread your tentacles throughout the organization.

                    <p>Don’t just schedule meetings haphazardly.

                        “Oh yeah, let’s get together next week at two o’clock, or 10 o’clock, whatever it might be.”

                        That does you no good. Schedule meetings with a very precise purpose, so they know the intent, and that they’re going to be challenged on their thinking. This comes back to the whole idea of having a clear Call to Action.

                    <p>When you ask for their opinion, don’t just ask for their opinion on your product. That’s stupid. Ask for their opinion on something bigger within the industry, within their supply chain, within the whole scope of things. In fact, when you start placing value in what they’re sharing with you, it’s amazing how much more information they’re going to share with you.

                    <p>If they see you as part of their industry, as part of their world, they’re going to be much more receptive to staying engaged with you. They are certainly going to be much more receptive to talking with you.

                        If you just talk in general terms, it’s irrelevant. But if you start using the vocabulary, the language, and talk about the issues that are happening in their world, it can make a big difference.

                    <p>Never start a call talking about yourself, or your company. It’s not about your achievements, or those of your company.

                        However, it’s okay to say, “Hey, I’ve seen this before.” Or, “I’ve been able to deal with other companies similar to yours with the same challenge.” It’s okay to say these kinds of phrases, because that’s a confirming statement.

                    <p>I love using subject matter experts. Suddenly, you’re not just a salesperson, but you’re bringing in other people.

                        You set up a follow-up call and you say, “Hey, I’m going to bring in ‘so-and-so’ from our labs or this tech person, and they’re going to share some additional insights with you.” Then, invite them to bring in other people.
