              There are a few different ways to ask for availability. You can
              email potential attendees ahead of time, or reach out to them
              individually by phone or in person. Whichever method you choose,
              be sure to give people plenty of notice so they can adjust their
              schedules if need be.

            Too many times if you ask canned questions, they lose interest in
            you. By asking them an unexpected question, you can truly get them
            thinking. Successfully engage with them at a much higher level and
            the conversation–even the relationship–will change.

            Why are you just talking to one person at that company you want to
            do business with? Be talking to four or five. If you want to keep
            the prospect engaged, get multiple people participating. Spread your
            tentacles throughout the organization.

            Schedule meetings purpose.

          <p>
            Don’t just schedule meetings haphazardly. “Oh yeah, let’s get
            together next week at two o’clock, or 10 o’clock, whatever it might
            be.” That does you no good. Schedule meetings with a very precise
            purpose, so they know the intent, and that they’re going to be
            challenged on their thinking. This comes back to the whole idea of
            having a clear Call to Action.

            Ask for their opinion.

          <p>
            When you ask for their opinion, don’t just ask for their opinion on
            your product. That’s stupid. Ask for their opinion on something
            bigger within the industry, within their supply chain, within the
            whole scope of things. In fact, when you start placing value in what
            they’re sharing with you, it’s amazing how much more information
            they’re going to share with you.

            If they see you as part of their industry, as part of their world,
            they’re going to be much more receptive to staying engaged with you.
            They are certainly going to be much more receptive to talking with
            you. If you just talk in general terms, it’s irrelevant. But if you
            start using the vocabulary, the language, and talk about the issues
            that are happening in their world, it can make a big difference.

            Never start a call talking about yourself, or your company. It’s not
            about your achievements, or those of your company. However, it’s
            okay to say, “Hey, I’ve seen this before.” Or, “I’ve been able to
            deal with other companies similar to yours with the same challenge.”
            It’s okay to say these kinds of phrases, because that’s a confirming
            statement.

          <p>
            I love using subject matter experts. Suddenly, you’re not just a
            salesperson, but you’re bringing in other people. You set up a
            follow-up call and you say, “Hey, I’m going to bring in ‘so-and-so’
            from our labs or this tech person, and they’re going to share some
            additional insights with you.” Then, invite them to bring in other
            people.
