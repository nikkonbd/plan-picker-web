              I appreciate your interest in joining a team, but I'm just a
              text-based AI and don't have the capability to participate in
              teams or organizations. However, I can certainly provide you with
              some general advice on how to join a team:
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );

export default JoinTeam;
