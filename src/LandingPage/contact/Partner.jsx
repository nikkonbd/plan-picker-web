          Becoming a partner in a business or organization typically involves a
          formal agreement or process, and the specific section you need to add
          will depend on the type of partnership you're entering into and the
          legal requirements in your jurisdiction. However, here are some common
          sections that are often included in partnership agreements:
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Partner;
