              Becoming a partner in a business or organization typically
              involves a formal agreement or process, and the specific section
              you need to add will depend on the type of partnership you're
              entering into and the legal requirements in your jurisdiction.
              However, here are some common sections that are often included in
              partnership agreements:

            Landing pages, segmented emails, the right software platform (more
            on that below), and smart use of our existing marketing channels all
            helped us get our partner program up and running quickly. As a
            result, we added over 4,000 partners in 2019, who now contribute an
            average of 15-20% of all our new trial starts (that’s a lot).{" "}

            Finding the Right Platform Partner
          </h2>
          <p>
            How will you communicate with partners, track their activity, and
            reward them? Investing in Partner Relationship Management (PRM) will
            streamline your program under one roof and take care of the more
            tedious functions like analytics, tracking, and payouts.
          </p>
          <p className="py-4">
            I’ve already talked about how smart it is to identify different
            partner types promoting you throughout the customer journey. To meet
            the needs of each of these segments, you’ll need a platform partner
            who can manage them with a single solution.
          </p>
          <p>
            In trying to find a PRM solution for Unbounce, it was frankly hard
            to find a provider with a focus on SMB SaaS. Most PRMs either leaned
            too far in favor of enterprise software on one end (reseller) or B2C
            consumer products on the other (affiliate).

            Some final advice: “Good artists copy, great artists steal.” (Hey,
            sometimes the clichés are spot on.) Join some SaaS partner programs
            of companies you admire. Take note of the entire journey from the
            time you hit their recruitment landing page through onboarding.

            What’s relevant to your business? What’s not? What could you do
            better? Finally, interview your peers on what’s working well for
            them, what’s tricky, and get advice on what they’d do differently.
            There’s gold in learning from those who have gone before you.{" "}
